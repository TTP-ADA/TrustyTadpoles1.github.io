Two friends, **one mission:** _Build a secure, reliable cardano stake pool_

We operate entirely on **locally hosted bare-metal servers** - never in the cloud. This approach lowers costs, strengthens decentralization, and shows our commitment to Cardano's long-term vision.

Each node is powered by **32 GB of RAM and 12 CPU cores**, far exceeding current requirements and ready to scale with future network upgrades.

_We're here for stability, security, and the community._

**We are the Trusty Tadpoles - small, resilient, and ready to grow with Cardano!**

# How to Stake with Us

1.  Use your browser or hardware wallet (Eternl, Lace, Daedalus, Yoroi, etc.)
2.  Got to the **Staking** or **Delegation** tab
3.  Search our pool by ticker: **TTP** (Trusty Tadpoles Pool)
4.  Select our pool and confirm delegation
5.  Start earning ADA!

**Important:**

*   You never send ADA directly to a pool - delegation is done inside your wallet
*   Your ADA always stays in your wallet, and you can spend or transfer at any time (liquid staking)
*   Never share your seed phrase, recovery phrase, or private keys with anyone. No legitimate stake pool will ever ask you for this information

Staking with Trusty Tadpoles **(TTP)** helps support decentralization, keeps the cardano network strong, and as we grow the rewards for participating will increase!
